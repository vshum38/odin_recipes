    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Red Wine: Spanish red wines are a go-to option for this recipe</li>
        <li>Liquor: To pair back with the red wine, it's traditional to use a little brandy.</li>
        <li>Chopped Fruit: Classic sangrias use diced oranges, apples, and lemon. But feel free to get creative with this based on seasonality!</li>
        <li>Sweetener: If your sangria is sweet enough from the fruits, then you won't need additional sweeteners. But you can always add a tablespoon or two of your favorite sweetener.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How To Make Sangria</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Chop the fruit: Dice the apple, orange, and lemon into small pieces or wedges. Make sure to leave the peels on and toss them into the pitcher.
        </li>
        <li>Give everything a stir: Pour the wine, brandy and any sweetener into the pitcher. Then stir everything together until it's all combined.</li>
        <li>Refrigerate: Chill for at least 4 hours, or overnight. The longer it sits, the more all the flavors meld together.</li>
        <li>Serve: Serve this sangria in individual glasses over ice, and top it off with sparkling water if you'd like! Make sure to get a few pieces of the fruit into the glass as well.
